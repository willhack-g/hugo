## Development of Robotics in Social and Technological Context


> **Key reflection**: Will the machines we created to assist us become our partners, or perhaps our new masters? The answer to this question is taking shape before our eyes, with each breakthrough in robotics and artificial intelligence.

## Introduction

Robotics, as a field of science and technology, has undergone a dramatic transformation from the times of first mechanical automatons to today's advanced autonomous systems. The term "robot", introduced by Czech playwright Karel ÄŒapek in 1920, etymologically derives from the Slavic root "rob-", meaning forced labor or slave labor. This linguistic origin provides a fascinating starting point for considering the evolution of human-machine relationships.

> **Formal definition**: A robot is a programmable multifunctional machine, designed to perform complex sequences of actions in response to environmental signals, characterized by a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making.

## History of Robotics - From Dreams to Reality

Human dreams of creating artificial life date back to antiquity. The first documented attempts at constructing automatic devices come from the following periods:

## Epilogue: Towards a New Beginning

We stand on the threshold of a transformation so fundamental that it may change not only our way of life but the very essence of human experience. Robotics ceases to be merely a tool â€“ it will become an integral part of human evolution. However, the fundamental (and entirely justified) problem today is the growing lack of trust in existing systems. We find ourselves at a difficult moment in history where on one hand we are witnessing breakthrough technological discoveries, while on the other we remain stuck in archaic systems created for realities completely different from contemporary ones. Governments composed of people caring only about their own factions' interests, revenues, and ideologies. Medicine more interested in profit than actual care for our health. The Church desperately trying to maintain remnants of power instead of focusing on our spiritual development and social integration. The press has ceased to be a medium for informing society and has become a medium for manipulating worldview. Technology corporations mainly focused on finding new forms of exploiting our weaknesses.

In such a world, the only consequence of technological development seems to be the increase in social inequalities and further, dizzying enrichment of the few at the expense of the masses. No sane person (unless completely paralyzed) will agree to have a chip implanted in their brain developed by a profit-driven private corporation. After a year, the corporation will change the terms of service and ads will start displaying in our heads {{< icon "face-wink" >}}

This opens up the field for discussion in another article: How can we change current systems? What possibilities do we have? What specifically can we do? I'll just mention that new perspectives are emerging thanks to Blockchain technologies and the concept of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).
