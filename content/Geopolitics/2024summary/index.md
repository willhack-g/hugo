## End of 2024

### 1. Donald Trump's Return to the White House
Donald Trump's re-election as the 47th President of the United States marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. His victory, secured with 312 electoral votes, signaled a return to his "America First" agenda, focusing on immigration restrictions, deregulation, and a more confrontational stance towards traditional allies like NATO. Trump's re-election has raised concerns about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine, as he has hinted at reducing aid and prioritizing domestic issues over international commitments[citation:4][citation:8].

### 2. The Fall of Bashar al-Assad's Regime
2024 saw the end of Bashar al-Assad's two-decade-long rule in Syria. The collapse of his regime, marked by internal divisions and international pressure, has led to a recalibration of strategies by key allies like Russia and Iran. This shift has significant implications for the Middle East, particularly in terms of regional power dynamics and the ongoing conflict in Syria[citation:4].

### 3. Paris 2024 Olympics: A Political and Social Platform
The Paris 2024 Olympics were not just a sporting event but also a platform for global political and social issues. The games highlighted tensions between nations, with some countries boycotting the event due to political disagreements. Environmental organizations also used the event to push for stronger climate action, reflecting the growing intersection of sports and global issues[citation:4].

### 4. Controversial Amnesty Law in Spain
In June 2024, Spain's Congress of Deputies approved a controversial amnesty law aimed at addressing political conflicts, particularly in Catalonia. The law has sparked intense debates and protests, with critics arguing that it undermines the rule of law. This move has further polarized Spanish politics and could have long-term implications for the country's unity and governance[citation:4].

### 5. Economic Growth in Spain
Despite global challenges, Spain's economy emerged as one of the strongest in the OECD in 2024. The country's recovery from previous economic crises, coupled with investments in infrastructure and social programs, has positioned it as a leader in economic resilience. This growth has been recognized by international observers, including *The Economist*, which highlighted Spain's economic achievements[citation:4].
