Looking for a simple way to enter the world of cryptocurrencies? Pi Network might be the perfect starting point! This innovative crypto project has been generating a lot of excitement since its founding in 2019 by Stanford graduates. Let's explore what makes Pi Network unique and why it might be worth joining today.

When I started my Pi adventure about four years ago, I was skeptical about the project. It had many promises but also many flaws. I built my group, but I didn't promise them anything. I even claimed that the project might not succeed - but since it costs nothing - it's worth a try.
In February 2025, it turned out that it was worth it. Pi cryptocurrency entered the stock exchange with a starting price of $2, and I supplemented my budget; you can do that too.

## Pi Network's Revolutionary Vision: Democratizing Cryptocurrency

The core mission of Pi Network is truly revolutionary: to create the most inclusive peer-to-peer ecosystem and online experience, powered by Pi, potentially the most widely distributed cryptocurrency in the world. The founders envisioned breaking down the barriers that make cryptocurrencies inaccessible to the average person. They wanted to make digital currency available to everyone, regardless of technical knowledge or expensive mining equipment.

To achieve this, Pi Network was designed as a platform that allows users to "mine" cryptocurrency directly from their smartphones with minimal impact on device resources. This approach makes cryptocurrencies accessible to billions of people worldwide!

## How Pi "Mining" Works: The Simplest Mining Experience Ever

The Pi mining process is incredibly simple â€“ it involves pressing a button in the mobile app daily. The application runs in the background and is designed to consume minimal battery and mobile data. Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work systems, Pi mining doesn't require solving complex mathematical problems or owning specialized hardware.

Pi Network utilizes a consensus mechanism based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), making it significantly more energy-efficient and potentially more scalable than traditional methods. The network distinguishes three main roles:
- Pioneers (basic users mining Pi)
- Contributors (users inviting others and building security circles)
- Nodes (users running software on computers to validate transactions)

Security circles, created by adding trusted members to the network, help secure the blockchain and increase individual mining rates.

## Development Milestones and Mainnet Launch: A Significant Step Forward

Pi Network has followed a carefully prepared development plan. The Beta phase started in 2019, followed by the launch of the Testnet in 2020, which allowed for testing the stability and performance of the blockchain. The next step was the launch of the Enclosed Mainnet in December 2021, which lasted until February 20, 2025.

A key moment was the launch of the Open Mainnet on February 20, 2025. This phase marked the transition to a fully decentralized network with the possibility of external connections. The launch of Open Mainnet unlocked key features, such as:
- The ability to transfer Pi coins to external wallets
- Listings on cryptocurrency exchanges
- Creation of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Pi blockchain

Full participation in the Open Mainnet requires completing the KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process, which aims to ensure the integrity of the network, prevent the creation of multiple accounts per user, and comply with regulatory requirements.

## The Global Pi Community: A Huge Network of Pioneers

Pi Network has gathered an impressive global community of over 60 million registered users. Over 14 million users have completed KYC verification and are referred to as "Pioneers." Additionally, over 10 million users have migrated their coins to the mainnet.

Pi Network's presence on social media is also significant, with millions of followers on platforms such as Reddit, Telegram, Twitter, and YouTube. An analysis of Pi Network website traffic indicates the global reach of the project, with significant user participation from countries such as Vietnam, India, the United States, and South Korea.

## Future Benefits of Holding Pi Currency: Utility and Value

Pi Network's vision involves becoming a widely used means of exchanging goods and services within its ecosystem. A Pi Browser application has been developed with a non-custodial wallet, allowing users to send Pi within the ecosystem. A key element in building utility is the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Pi blockchain, which can significantly expand the cryptocurrency's uses beyond simple transactions.

Pi Network has the potential to contribute to financial inclusion in regions with limited banking infrastructure, offering a decentralized financial system accessible via smartphones. After the launch of the Open Mainnet, Pi is listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, increasing its liquidity and accessibility to a wider range of investors.

## Pi Network Compared to Other Cryptocurrencies: Unique Features

Pi Network stands out from other cryptocurrencies with its approach to "mining," which is accessible via a mobile application and does not require energy-intensive hardware, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. The use of Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) as a consensus mechanism distinguishes Pi from Bitcoin (Proof-of-Work) and Ethereum (Proof-of-Stake).

While Bitcoin is often seen as "digital gold" and a store of value, and Ethereum as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), Pi Network focuses on community communication and everyday payments.

Here's a comparison of Pi Network with Bitcoin and Ethereum:

| Feature | Pi Network | Bitcoin | Ethereum |
|---------|------------|---------|----------|
| Consensus Mechanism | Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) | Proof-of-Work (PoW) | Proof-of-Stake (PoS) |
| Mining Process | Mobile application (daily click), energy-efficient | Specialized hardware (ASIC), energy-intensive | Staking (locking existing coins) |
| Market Capitalization (approx.) | ~$9.14 billion (March 2025) | ~$1.6 trillion (est. March 2025) | ~$400 billion (est. March 2025) |
| Transaction Speed | Up to 70,000 TPS* (claimed) | ~7 TPS* | ~15-30 TPS* |
| Main Uses | Everyday payments, community ecosystem | Digital gold, store of value | Smart contracts, dApps, DeFi, NFT |
| Distribution | Mobile mining based on referrals | Mining rewards | Staking rewards, initial coin offering (ICO) |
| Project Maturity | Early phase, mainnet launched in 2025 | Established, mature | Established, mature |
* TPS - Transactions per second.

## Practical Applications of Pi Network: Building a Useful Ecosystem

A key aspect of Pi Network's development is building a useful ecosystem. Plans include creating a marketplace within the network where users can exchange goods and services for Pi. Additionally, over 100 decentralized applications (dApps) are being developed in the Pi ecosystem covering various sectors, such as DeFi, gaming, and online trading platforms. These initiatives aim to increase the practical use of Pi.

As the ecosystem matures and adoption grows, there is the potential to use Pi in everyday transactions. The project also organized Pi Hackathon to encourage developers to create Pi-based applications and develop the ecosystem. In some regions, there have already been cases of using Pi for transactions between users, albeit on a limited scale for now.

## Conclusion: Why You Should Consider Joining Pi Network Today

Pi Network presents an ambitious vision aimed at democratizing access to cryptocurrencies through an innovative mobile mining mechanism. The launch of the mainnet in February 2025 was a significant step in the project's development, opening new opportunities for Pi's utility and potential value. The large and global community of users is a significant asset, suggesting the potential for network effects.
Having a wallet with PI currency that you can immediately transfer to any exchange (without asking anyone for permission or approval) or to any private user or company in the Pi ecosystem is also not without significance. In today's world, I would even say that this significance is growing exponentially over time.

Joining Pi Network in its current phase does not involve financial risk, as "mining" is free. This is an opportunity available to anyone who owns a smartphone.
At the moment, you won't make a fortune in the project, but a few to several hundred dollars a month can be useful to everyone.
To maximize income from the very beginning you should:
- download and install the application on the phone, after a month of use, go through the KYC - authentication process.
- in the application, you have an invitation link that you can send via social media to family and friends
- add five people who joined from your invitation to the security circle
- install the Pi browser (the link is in the application) and be active on forums and projects through the browser
- block part of your income for a specified time to speed up "mining"
- install a node on the computer, which will significantly speed up mining (more on how to do it in a separate article)
