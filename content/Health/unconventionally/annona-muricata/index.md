## Introduction
Graviola (Annona muricata) and described in another article [annona-reticulata](/health/unconventionally/annona-reticulata/), are two similar plants with amazing properties for the human body. It is worth getting acquainted with both.

Graviola, also known as soursop, guanabana, paw-paw, or sirsak, is a small, evergreen tropical tree valued for its tasty fruit and medicinal properties. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America but is now widespread in many tropical countries, including North Africa and Southeast Asia.

For centuries, various cultures have used Graviola in traditional medicine to treat a wide range of ailments, from parasitic infections to fever and digestive problems. The leaves, bark, roots, seeds, and fruits were used in the form of infusions, decoctions, and extracts. Modern phytotherapy and the dietary supplement industry also appreciate Graviola, offering it in the form of capsules, juices, syrups, and teas, especially popular in the USA and Europe.

Interest in Graviola has increased in recent years, particularly in the context of the search for natural methods to support health and treat chronic diseases. Scientific research focuses on its potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antidiabetic properties, making it a promising object of study for scientists and dietary supplement manufacturers.

## Latest scientific research

### Antidiabetic effect

A study published in 2021 in the journal *Antioxidants* analyzes in detail the protective effect of graviola extract (AME) on liver damage caused by hyperglycemia in mice with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes was induced in mice by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Diabetic mice received AME orally (50 or 100 mg/kg body weight) for 9 weeks. The study showed that AME, especially at a lower dose (50 mg/kg), brings a number of metabolic and liver-protective benefits:

1. **Metabolic effects:**
   - **Lowering fasting blood glucose (FBG)**: AME significantly lowered FBG levels compared to the diabetic control group.
   - **Reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**: AME contributed to the reduction of HbA1c, which indicates better glycemic control over a longer period.
   - **Improving glucose tolerance**: The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed that AME improves the body's ability to absorb glucose.
   - **Reducing insulin resistance**: AME reduced insulin resistance, measured by the HOMA-IR index.

2. **Effect on the liver:**
   - **Reducing lipid accumulation in the liver**: Histopathological examination of the liver showed fewer fat droplets (lipid droplets) in the AME group.
   - **Normalization of triglyceride (TG) levels**: AME effectively lowered elevated triglyceride levels in the liver to near-normal values.
   - **Improving liver morphology**: AME contributed to the improvement of liver structure, reducing signs of steatosis.
   - **Reducing oxidative stress**: AME lowered the level of oxidative stress markers in the liver, such as 4-HNE and protein carbonyl groups.

3. **Mechanisms of action at the molecular level:**
   - **Increasing the expression of proteins related to insulin signaling (IRS-1, GLUT2)**: AME increased the level of IRS-1 and GLUT2, key proteins in the insulin signaling pathway, which improves insulin sensitivity.
   - **Regulation of lipid metabolism via the AMPK/PGC1α pathway**: AME activated the AMPK/PGC1α pathway, which regulates energy and lipid metabolism in the liver, promoting fatty acid combustion.
   - **Activation of autophagy in liver cells**: AME stimulated autophagy, the process of removing damaged cells and organelles, which is important in the context of liver diseases associated with diabetes.
   - **Normalization of oxidative stress markers (Nrf2, NQO1)**: AME affected the Nrf2/NQO1 pathways, regulating the antioxidant response of cells and reducing oxidative stress.

### Anticancer effect

Research published in *Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity* in 2018, in the article "Anticancer Properties of Graviola (Annona muricata): A Comprehensive Mechanistic Review", provides a comprehensive review of the anticancer mechanisms of graviola, based on a broad analysis of scientific literature. This article emphasizes that extracts from graviola and its bioactive components show promising effects in the fight against various types of cancer, acting on many cellular and molecular levels:

1. **Main mechanisms of action:**
   - **Induction of apoptosis (programmed death of cancer cells)**: Graviola activates apoptotic pathways in cancer cells, leading to their self-destruction. Studies have shown the induction of apoptosis in many types of cancer, including breast, colon, lung, leukemia, and others.
   - **Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation**: Extracts from graviola effectively inhibit the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells by stopping the cell cycle in various phases (G1, G2/M).
   - **Modulation of signaling pathways associated with cancer development**: Graviola affects key signaling pathways, such as EGFR, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT, which are often disturbed in cancer cells and promote their growth and survival.
   - **Antioxidant effect**: Graviola exhibits strong antioxidant properties, which helps protect cells from damage caused by oxidative stress, which is associated with cancer development.

2. **Confirmed effectiveness against cells of various types of cancer:**
   - **Breast cancer** (cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, T47D)
   - **Colorectal cancer** (cell lines HT-29, HCT-116, COLO-205, DLD-1)
   - **Pancreatic cancer** (cell lines FG/COLO357, CD18/HPAF, Capan-1, PACA-2)
   - **Lung cancer** (cell lines A549, H-460, NCI-H292)
   - **Leukemia** (cell lines U-937, K562, HL-60, CCRF-CEM, CEM/ADR5000)
   - **Prostate cancer** (cell line PC-3)
   - **Liver cancer** (cell lines Hep G2, Bel-7402, Hep 2,2,15)
   - **Oral cancer** (cell line KB)
   - **Melanoma** (cell line A375)
   - **Glioma** (cell lines SF-268, U87MG, U87MG.ΔEGFR)
   - **Cervical cancer** (cell line HeLa)
   - **Ovarian cancer** (cell line A2780)
   - **Skin cancer** (cell lines UW-BCC1, A431, SCC-25)

3. **Active anticancer compounds:**
   - **Annonaceous acetogenins**: This is the main group of bioactive compounds in graviola, exhibiting strong cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. Over 100 different annonaceous acetogenins have been identified.
   - **Flavonoids**: Rutin, quercetin, and kaempferol, known for their antioxidant and anticancer properties, are also present in graviola.
   - **Alkaloids**: Another group of bioactive compounds that may contribute to the anticancer effect of graviola.

4. **Molecular mechanisms:**
   - **Activation of caspases 3/7 and 9**: Graviola induces apoptosis by activating caspases, executioner enzymes of programmed cell death.
   - **Regulation of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins**: Graviola affects the balance between pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) proteins, promoting apoptosis.
   - **Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway**: Graviola inhibits the NF-κB pathway, which is associated with inflammatory processes and the survival of cancer cells.

## Chemical composition

Phytochemical analyses have revealed a wealth of bioactive components in Graviola, confirming its pharmacological potential. Among over 212 identified compounds, the key groups are:

- **Annonaceous acetogenins:** A unique class of polyketide compounds, characteristic of the Annonaceae family, including Graviola.

## Methods of preparing tea from leaves

### Basic method (for taste)
1. Ingredients:
   - 2-3 mature graviola leaves (dark green, without spots)
   - 1 cup of water

2. Preparation:
   - Wash the leaves under running water and dry
   - Cut with a knife into strips 0.5-1 cm wide (increases the extraction surface)
   - Put into a stoneware or glass dish
   - Pour boiling water and cover
   - Brew for 15-20 minutes under cover
   - Strain through a fine-mesh strainer

### Intensive method (for health properties)
Using research from the article by Flores et al. (2023):
1. Ingredients:
